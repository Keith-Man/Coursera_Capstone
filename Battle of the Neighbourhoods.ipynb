Starting a business in a suburb that has no market for it can result in significant loss of invested time and resources. Because of this, it is useful to have some method to predict what businesses stand a higher chance of doing well.\nThere are many metrics that can be used to judge what business opportunities are more likely to succeed, but one of them is to look into the median house prices of different suburbs.\nMedian house prices can give some indication of the spending potential of people living in the area, which in turn affects the range of venues that are located in the area.\nThe goal of this investigation is to find out if median house prices do have a noticable effect on the venue distribution of suburbs and, if so, what businesses are more likely to do well in less expensive suburbs and more expensive suburbs."
