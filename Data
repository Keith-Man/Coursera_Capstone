Data

The data used in this investigation will primarily come from two sources, Foursquare API and the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). 
The Foursquare API will provide information for suburb clustering and variety of venues within suburbs. 
The ABS will provide information regarding population density, average resident salary, median house prices in different suburbs and other statistical information as necessary.

Foursquare API data can be matched with ABS statistics to provide potential reasons for the clustering of inter-city and intra-city suburbs. 
From this information, Adelaide suburbs that closely match Sydney suburbs can be found and used to suggest potential business opportunities in Adelaide that are not currently present.
